sorting a set of numbers with 2 stacks a and b with 6 specific operations:

	sa: swap the first two elements of A
	sb: swap the first two elements of B
	pa: pop A into B
	pb: pop B into A
	ra: swap the first and last element of the stack
	rb: swap the first and last element of the stack
	rra: swap the last and first element of the stack
	rrb: swap the last and first element of the stack

** Skills developped **
	
	-research on different sorting algorithms.
	-implementation of a variant of merge sort, where the problem is divided 
	 into 3 subproblems and base case is of 3 elements;
